- [ ] Add data caching/SWR for better performance
- [ ] Consider adding Zod for schema validation
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript strict mode compliance

## Database Schema Status

‚úÖ **Fully Implemented Tables:**

## Known Issues

None currently - all implemented features working as expected.

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Manual Testing Checklist:**
   - [ ] Create ministry ‚Üí Create department ‚Üí Create scheme (full flow)
   - [ ] Test all CRUD operations for departments
   - [ ] Test all CRUD operations for schemes
   - [ ] Test search and filter functionality
   - [ ] Test form validations (required fields, formats)
   - [ ] Test authorization checks
   - [ ] Test error scenarios (duplicate codes, etc.)

2. **Data Integrity:**
   - [ ] Verify cascade deletes work correctly
   - [ ] Test relationship constraints
   - [ ] Verify RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
